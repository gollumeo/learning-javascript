## Description

Today's course is about learning how to use and code with JavaScript. We'll go through a bunch of steps, exercises, challenges and lessons to be able, at the end, to use and learn how to make a good use of this programming language!
In other words, this repository will contain several tiny projects drawing my progress in JS.
